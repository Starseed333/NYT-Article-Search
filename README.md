# **NYT Article Search**

### **Description**

A New York Times web application where users can retrieve anywhere from one to ten articles from a topic of their choice. This is done using the ajax method combined with the New York Times API key. The ajax() method is used to perform an AJAX (asynchronous HTTP) request. All jQuery AJAX methods use the ajax() method. This method is mostly used for requests where the other methods cannot be used.
